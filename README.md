# Problem:
The goal is to facilitate the monitoring and use of a cistern in households, now that water problems make it practically essential to have one.

# Objective:
To provide users with an optimal and efficient solution for using a cistern in combination with the Internet of Things, making it easier to control the water level in their tanks for those who do not have direct access.

# Proposed Solution:
By using our device connected to your local network in the "IoT Remote" application, you can determine the water level in your tank and also have a button within the application that will allow automatic tank filling. You will be able to graphically visualize water consumption by days, hours, and weeks.

# Technologies used:
The solution will be implemented using Android Studio as the IDE, Kotlin as the programming language, and XML for the design. The app should run on Android 8.0 or higher.
